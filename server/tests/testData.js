    title: "UG raises 2025/26 academic fees by over 25%",
    text: "Students of the University of Ghana are expressing concern following a significant increase in academic fees for the 2025/2026 academic year, with increments exceeding 25 percent across all colleges.\n\nAlthough university management is yet to officially explain the reasons behind the sharp rise, the provisional schedule of academic fees for the 2025/26 academic year shows substantial upward adjustments affecting both fresh and continuing students.\n\nAt the College of Humanities, approved fees indicate that Level 100 students will pay GH¢3,110 for the 2025/26 academic year, representing a 34 percent increase from the GH¢2,319 charged in the 2024/25 academic year. Continuing students at the college will pay GH¢2,253, reflecting a 27 percent increase from the previous GH¢1,777.\n\nSimilarly, at the University of Ghana School of Law, undergraduate freshers under the College of Humanities will pay GH¢3,226, a 33 percent increase from GH¢2,435 last academic year. Continuing law students will also see their fees rise from GH¢1,890 to GH¢2,396.\n\nOther colleges, including Health Sciences, Basic and Applied Sciences, and Education, have also recorded fee hikes ranging between 25 and 35 percent. The increases have generated agitation among students and parents, many of whom say the changes were introduced without prior notice.\n\nThe new fee structure also highlights a sharp rise in third-party fees, which appear to be a major contributor to the overall increase. While third-party fees stood at GH¢255 during the 2024/25 academic year, they have increased to GH¢767 for freshmen and GH¢455 for continuing students for the 2025/26 academic year.\n\nA breakdown of these charges includes an SRC Hostel Development Levy of GH¢300, a GH¢100 contribution towards the university’s 75th Anniversary Legacy Project, SRC welfare dues of GH¢50, and reprographic fees of GH¢5. Fresh Level 100 and diploma students are also required to pay GH¢312 for a Telecel data package, while continuing students may opt into a Telecel data and airtime package at GH¢10.22 per month.\n\nStudents are calling on university authorities to provide clearer justification for the sudden fee hikes, warning that the increases could place additional financial strain on students and their families.\n\nTags: GhanaGhana NewsUG",

    text: "Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) says it will implement temporary water rationing in some Accra communities from January 5, 2026, citing maintenance work at a key pumping station.\n\nAccording to the company, affected areas include Adenta, Madina, East Legon, and parts of Teshie. GWCL said the rationing will run for two weeks and that water tankers will be deployed to critical institutions such as hospitals and schools.\n\nSome residents told reporters the announcement came late and that prior rationing schedules were not consistently followed. GWCL urged customers to store water responsibly and said updates will be provided through official channels.\n\nThe statement did not specify the exact daily rationing hours for each community, and consumer groups called for a more detailed timetable to reduce disruption.",

It added that findings will be published after stakeholder meetings.\n\nTelecom operators argue that fees support network expansion and security investments. Some market traders and gig workers say rising fees reduce their take-home earnings and push customers back to cash.\n\nThe notice did not indicate whether the review could lead to a fee cap or timeline for any changes.",
